				Our CEO, Peter, credits his hardworking East Asian immigrant parents 
				who undertook the arduous journey to the shores of America with the 
				intention of giving their children the best future. His mother's wizardy 
				in the kitchen whipping up the tastiest dishes with whatever is available 
				inexpensively at the supermarket, was his first inspiration to create the 
				fusion cuisines for which The Frying Pan became well known. He brings his 
				zeal for fusion cuisines to this restaurant, pioneering cross-cultural 
				culinary connections.
